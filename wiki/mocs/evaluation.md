# Evaluation — Map of Content
> Navigation hub for agent evaluation, benchmarking, self-critique, and judge patterns.

---

## Core Concepts

- [[concepts/llm-as-judge]] — Using LLMs to evaluate other LLM outputs; criteria design, bias, calibration
- [[concepts/trajectory-evaluation]] — Evaluating the full sequence of agent decisions, not just final output
- [[concepts/self-critique]] — Agents reviewing and improving their own outputs; reflection loops
- [[concepts/benchmark-design]] — Designing benchmarks for agentic tasks; task suites, success criteria, repeatability
- [[concepts/agent-failure-modes]] — Failure taxonomy; useful as eval criteria scaffold
- [[concepts/rag-systems]] — RAG eval metrics: recall@k, precision@k, MRR, nDCG, factuality, citation correctness
- [[concepts/integration-verification]] — Verifying integrations end-to-end as eval criteria
- [[concepts/goal-vs-task-completion]] — Goal completion ≠ task completion; verification criteria

## Evaluations in This KB

- [[evaluations/eval-memory-approaches]] — In-context vs file-wiki vs vector DB vs knowledge graph; file-wiki wins for Jay's use case
- [[evaluations/eval-orchestration-frameworks]] — GSD vs [[framework-langgraph]] vs [[framework-autogen]] vs [[framework-crewai]] vs raw [[framework-claude-code]]; GSD first, raw [[framework-claude-code]] second
- [[evaluations/eval-nous-research-hermes]] — Nous Research Hermes vs Jay's Hermes orchestrator

---

## Patterns

- [[patterns/pattern-compounding-loop]] — Verified ingest (×1.25 boost) as a primitive eval signal; quality gate on promotion
- [[patterns/pattern-agent-proof-of-work-loop]] — Closed-loop agent verification: output → verification → receipts → exception review → learning update

---

## Frameworks

### Eval-First Frameworks (added 2026-04-18 via /autoresearch)

- [[frameworks/framework-inspect-ai]] — UK AISI open-source eval framework; strongest agent + sandbox story in the cohort
- [[frameworks/framework-deepeval]] — Pytest-native eval with named agent metrics (PlanQuality, ToolCalling, ArgumentCorrectness)
- [[frameworks/framework-promptfoo]] — Declarative YAML eval + red-team CLI; now [[openai]]-owned, MIT
- [[frameworks/framework-langsmith]] — LangChain's proprietary eval + observability SaaS; unique trace-to-dataset workflow

### Agent-Stack Frameworks with Eval Features

- [[frameworks/framework-gsd]] — GSD verifier agent: four-level artifact check, stub detection, data-flow trace
- [[frameworks/framework-claude-code]] — [[framework-claude-code]]: built-in test running, hook-based verification
- [[frameworks/framework-langgraph]] — [[framework-langsmith]] evaluation integration for [[framework-langgraph]] agents

## Recipes

- [[recipes/recipe-agent-evaluation]] — Build an [[llm-as-judge]] evaluation harness for agents end-to-end

## System Policies (V2 — Promotion as Eval)

The V2 runtime uses promotion scoring as an inline evaluation mechanism:

- [[system/policies/promotion-rules]] — Scoring formula: evidence × confidence × freshness × trust × novelty × explicit_approval
- [[system/policies/source-trust-policy]] — Trust scoring as a dimension of evaluation quality
- [[system/policies/freshness-policy]] — Freshness as a quality signal for canonical knowledge
- [[system/policies/contradiction-policy]] — Contradiction detection as an eval gate before promotion

> **[FRICTION] The "Promotion as Eval" framing above is contested.** [[syntheses/synthesis-promotion-scoring-without-a-judge]] (2026-08-26) argues all six terms of the promotion formula are provenance metadata — none read the claim — so promotion scoring is not an evaluation mechanism in the sense [[concepts/llm-as-judge]] means it. Unresolved; resolution requires the 20-page judge-vs-human calibration study proposed in that synthesis.

---

## Syntheses

- [[syntheses/synthesis-promotion-scoring-without-a-judge]] — Argues the promotion scorer measures how well a claim is documented, never whether it is true, leaving [[concepts/llm-as-judge]] unwired to the canonical gate it was built for
- [[syntheses/synthesis-verifier-as-goal-completion-benchmark]] — Argues the Plan-Execute-Verify verifier is the runtime implementation of goal-vs-task completion, convertible into a benchmark-design template
- [[syntheses/synthesis-proof-of-work-receipts-vs-trajectory-eval]] — Argues [[patterns/pattern-agent-proof-of-work-loop]] receipts are self-authored trajectories: they catch omission cheaply but are structurally blind to fabrication, which is what [[concepts/trajectory-evaluation]] and [[concepts/llm-as-judge]] exist to catch
- [[syntheses/synthesis-memory-selection-needs-a-benchmark-protocol]] — Argues `wiki/hot.md`'s memory tiering advice cites a self-flagged-stale LoCoMo result with no attached re-verification procedure, leaving [[concepts/benchmark-design]] unwired to [[evaluations/eval-memory-approaches]]
